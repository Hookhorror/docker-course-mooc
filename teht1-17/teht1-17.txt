I chose C# to my favourite programming environment.

I took a Ubuntu 16.04 as my base, and then installed there dependencies mentioned in https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux-package-manager-ubuntu-1604

Mentioned dependencies were:

.NET Core SDK
ASP.NET Core runtime
.NET Core runtime

Then I tested that I was able to create a new console project with command:
$ dotnet new console

and creating project was succesful.
